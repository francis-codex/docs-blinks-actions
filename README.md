## Intro

At exactly 2:05 PM ¬∑ Jun 25, 2024, the team at [Dialect](https://x.com/saydialect) announced the launching of Solana‚Äôs innovative Blinks, short for Blockchain Links: A powerful way of bringing crypto to the people and connecting Solana to the entire internet.

You can buy, sell, swap, vote, or engage with token-gated experiences without leaving your Twitter/X feed by installing a browser wallet. This guide will help developers go from zero-production with Blinks in a Blink üëÄ!

Blinks simplifies the process of online crypto transactions by reducing the long process. Rather than being redirected couple of times, you can complete it in one go. However, it‚Äôs important to remember that a Solana wallet(browsers-based) such as Phantom, Solflare and Backpack is still required to use Blinks, all you have to do, is to turn on Experimental features.

Using Solana Actions, you can turn any transaction into a blockchain link (Blinks) that can be shared anywhere on the internet ‚Äî no third party application required. Request a payment in a text message. Vote on governance in a chatroom. Buy an NFT on social media. It‚Äôs all possible. Blockchain links (Blinks) are interfaces and just one way to interact with Solana Actions, you could build the next way, Solana Actions are the APIs to deliver transactions on many surfaces.

## What are Solana Actions and Blinks?

Solana Actions are standard APIs that return transactions on the Solana blockchain to be previewed, signed, and sent across various contexts, including QR codes, buttons + widgets in mobile and desktop applications, and websites across the internet. Actions make it simple for developers to integrate the things you can do throughout the Solana ecosystem right into your environment, allowing users to make blockchain transactions without switching to another app or website.

Blockchain links ‚Äì or blinks ‚Äì turn any Solana Action into a shareable, metadata-rich link. Blinks allow Action-sensitive clients (browser extension wallets, bots,etc.) to display additional capabilities for the user. In a web browser, it might show a preview of the transaction in a wallet without going to a decentralized app;In a chat app like Discord, it could turn into buttons you can interact with. Blinks make it possible to do blockchain transactions from almost anywhere you can share a link.

## Difference between Actions and blinks?

Actions are APIs that allow complex logic (both on and off-chain) to be used to construct transaction messages that are previewed, signed, and sent by the client. Native buttons, QR codes, or URLs (blinks) can initiate an Action.

Blinks are one way to interact with an Action. Blinks allow users to execute blockchain transactions directly from URLs, making decentralized applications accessible from any platform or device.

## Solana Actions and Blinks Use Cases

Currently, Blinks are experimentally integrated with X, enabling real-time blockchain transaction processing. They have found utility in payments, smart contract signing, voting, donations, and token swaps on [Dialect](https://dial.to/).

Some Use-cases of Solana Actions might include:

Staking SOL to help secure the Solana network, including liquid staking tokens.
Allowing customers to pay at a retail store using a QR code scan.
Token-gated minting experiences.
Enabling e-commerce websites to accept cryptocurrency payments directly from product pages.
Integrating blockchain functionality into gaming platforms for in-game asset purchases and trades.

Some Use-cases of Solana Blinks might include:

Tipping content creators on social media without the need for complex wallet setups
Minting custom NFTs or participating in governance votes directly from URLs
Letting users vote on community policies via links in newsletters.

## How Do Blinks Works?

To get the most out of Helius in your Solana development:

1. **Leverage Enhanced RPC Nodes**: Replace public RPC endpoints with Helius nodes for improved performance and reliability.

2. **Utilize Enhanced Transaction Data**: Take advantage of the enriched transaction data to simplify your application logic and reduce the need for complex on-chain data processing.

3. **Implement Webhooks**: Use Helius Webhooks to create responsive, event-driven applications that react to on-chain events in real-time.

4. **Optimize NFT Handling**: Leverage the NFT and DAS APIs to streamline NFT-related operations in your applications.

5. **Combine Multiple Helius Products**: Integrate multiple Helius products to create powerful, feature-rich applications.

## Best Practices and Tips

1. **API Key Management**: Securely store and manage your Helius API keys. Never expose them in client-side code.

2. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of rate limits for different Helius products and implement appropriate throttling in your applications.

3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential API downtime or rate limiting issues.

4. **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to reduce unnecessary API calls and improve your application's performance.

5. **Webhook Security**: When using webhooks, implement proper security measures such as signature verification to ensure the integrity of received data.

6. **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on Helius documentation and updates to take advantage of new features and improvements.

7. **Community Engagement**: Participate in the Helius community to share knowledge, get support, and stay informed about best practices.
